<h2>3.2.3 Changes of state and specific latent heat</h2>
<ul>
<li>Describe latent heat as the energy needed for a substance to change state</li>
<li>Define specific latent heat</li>
<li>Use the equation $E=mL$</li>
<li>Distinguish between latent heat of fusion and vapourisation</li>
<li>Interpret heating and cooling graphs that include changes of state</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>Specific Latent Heat of fusion</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy required to change 1 kg of ice to 1kg of water at constant temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Specific latent heat of vapourisation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy required to change 1 kg of liquid water to 1kg of steam at room temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$$E=mL$$</p>
<ul>
<li>E: latent heat in joules (J)</li>
<li>m: mass in kilograms (kg)</li>
