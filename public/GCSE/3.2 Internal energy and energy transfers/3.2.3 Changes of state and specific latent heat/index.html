<h1>Specific Latent Heat of fusion</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy required to change 1 kg of ice to 1kg of water at constant temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Specific latent heat of vapourisation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy required to change 1 kg of liquid water to 1kg of steam at room temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$$E=mL$$</p>
